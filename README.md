# Network Modeling (HS 2023)

This repository contains solutions to two assignments from the **Network Modeling** course (HS 2023), which covered graph-based models for analyzing social networks using R.

## Course Topics
- **Network Models**: Random graphs, small-world, preferential attachment
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Quadratic Assignment Procedure (QAP) Regression
- **Network Structure Models**:
  - **Single Network Observation**: Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs)
  - **Panel Data**: Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (SAOMs)

## Assignment 1: MR-QAP and ERGM
Analyzed a high-school friendship network using:
- **MR-QAP** to test hypotheses on gender, smoking, and activities.
- **ERGM** for network simulation and estimation of structural parameters.

## Assignment 2: SAOM and Network Evolution
Used **SAOMs** to:
- Simulate network evolution and evaluate model fit using triad census counts.
- Analyze co-evolution of friendships and behaviors in the Teenage Friends and Lifestyle Study.
